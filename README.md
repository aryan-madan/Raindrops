# raindrops

(yes the name is inspired by airdrop)
a little tool to share files between your mac and everything else.

## what is this?
it's a native mac app that starts a local web server on your wifi. this lets you share files with androids, windows pcs, or linux machines just by opening a link in their browser. basically airdrop, but for everyone.

## how it works
1. launch the app on your mac.
2. type or copy paste the local address it shows into your other device's browser by clicking on it.
3. upload files to send them to your mac, or download files your mac is sharing.

files land instantly in a `Raindrops` folder in your downloads. so basically as fast as ur local wifi speed.

## why i made it
i dont like airdrop, and sending files to myself from an android phone or using google drive to send files is time and space taking.

i wanted something that felt native, private, and fast, so i decided to build my own and learn swift

## built with
- swift & swiftui for the app
- vapor for the local server
