# raindrops
(yes the name is inspired by airdrop)
a modern tool to share files between your mac and everything else.

## demo
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcfe7d10-9958-4f2b-8944-3aec410ac0d2

## what is this?
it's a native mac app that spins up a server on your machine. this lets you share files with androids, windows pcs, or linux machines just by opening a link in their browser. basically airdrop, but for everyone.

## features
- **local transfer:** blazing fast sharing over your local wifi.
- **go public:** click one button to generate a public link (via cloudflare -tunnel) to share files with anyone, anywhere in the world.
- **browser based:** no app needed on the receiving device.
- **native ui:** built with swiftui, looking right at home on macos.


## why
i didnt like that apple airdrop walled you into one ecosystem and i wanted something to transfer files quickly and not have to give my files / images to google :(
so, i made this :D

files land instantly in a `Raindrops` folder in your downloads.

## built with
- swift & swiftui
- vapor
